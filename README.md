# Dog Walker Path Simulator

This is a simple, single-page web tool built to simulate and analyze different pathing configurations for a dog and a dog walker. The goal is to find the path configuration that minimizes the maximum required leash length between the two.

The concept of the challenge and the paths used in this simulation are from **Bruno Teheux** and **Hugo Parlier**

## 🚀 How to Use

This tool is a self-contained HTML file. No server or setup is required.

1.  Download the `index.html` file.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).

## 🎛️ Features

* **Path Configuration Dropdown:** Select from one of the four pre-defined pathing scenarios.
* **Dual Sliders:** Independently control the position of the "Dog" and "Dog Walker" along their respective paths.
* **Step Buttons:** Move forward one step at a time.
* **Backwards Movement:** An optional checkbox allows you to enable backwards movement and buttons.
* **Live Readouts:**
    * **Current Leash Length:** Shows the real-time distance between the two points.
    * **Max Leash Length:** Records and displays the maximum leash length reached during the current session. This value resets when you change path configurations.
